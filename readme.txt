Web application coded using Python and the framework Django.
This framework offers lots of features to simplify the 
development of web applications. We also used Bootstrap for
the CSS part.

We wanted to create a simplify DropBox. We start by creating 
a picture host. Then, we continue with all kind of file.
We add an album feature, with thumbnails for the picture
and direct link for the other documents.
The desing of the app make her easy to use, and fast.

We are very proud of it. We think that the objetives are 
complete.

- Show all the pictures and documents in two galleries.
  Pictures are displayed as thumbnails and documents with
  their name and direct link ;
